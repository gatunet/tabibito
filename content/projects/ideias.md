Just a couple of ideias I had for projects, fell free to do it yourself if you want.

### Vaultwarden client

A more macos/ios native client for vaultwardne(FOSS bitwarden server), with a topbar icon(similiar to OTP Auth icon) that's like the browser extension, and a better search bar on the clients. Maybe also webkit extension?

### Freetube Swift client

A native macos/ios/android? client like [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io), using the [Invidious API](https://docs.invidious.io/api/), tha has sync through Icloud iwth e2ee.

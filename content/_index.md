I'm a software developer that likes to do self-hosting/homelab stuff, so here I'll be documenting some of the things I do, not only for further reference, but also to maybe help someone.

If you find any mistakes and want to help, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/gatunet/tabibito). Thank you in advance.
